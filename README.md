### 🔴 Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - As I am currently working being able to follow through with my schedule would be difficult. I would also be competing with candidates who have 3-4 year degrees or more project experience. I do also have imposter syndrome or self doubt. 
    - to overcome these challenges I will create a weekly schedule with at least 1-2 hours of fucused coding, and focus on debth not quantity. for the limited experience I'll create a portfolio, build real-world context. I need to also Track small wins. Compare yourself to where I've been and not others. Find a mentor or community.
      
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:

🧠 Tech Meetups & Events

I need to join these to meet developers and hiring managers:
	•	ZATech Meetups (Slack + in-person in Cape Town)
Great for job leads, open-source collabs, and mentoring.
	•	CTJS (Cape Town JavaScript Meetup)
Focused on JavaScript and React developers.
	•	CodeBridge Community (Claremont)
Local tech hub supporting upskilling and collaboration.
	•	Tech Talks Cape Town / ProductTank / DevOpsCT
Great for exposure to UI/UX, design systems, and real-world projects.

🌐 Online & Local:
- OfferZen Community: Free resources, mentor programs, and hiring guides
-	GirlCodeZA: Coding bootcamps + mentorships
-	Women in Tech ZA: Networking and guidance especially for underrepresented groups
-	LinkedIn outreach: I will message junior devs/designers who work at Amazon, OfferZen, or top SA startups and ask for a 15–20 minute coffee chat.

 🖥️ Short Courses (Free & Paid):
 - FreeCodeCamp (free) - For advanced JavaScript + front-end projects
 - Scrimba ( offered at CodeSpace) - Great for UI-focused React & animation
